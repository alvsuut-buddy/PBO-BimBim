# 🚗 BimBim 

BimBim is a GUI-based car rental application. This project was created to fulfill an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) assignment by implementing the MVC (Model–View–Controller) architecture. The application simulates a simple car rental process. Users can select a car type, specify the number of units and rental duration, view the cost details (invoice), upload proof of payment, and share the delivery location.
